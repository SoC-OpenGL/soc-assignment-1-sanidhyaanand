Hi!

Sorry for not making an MD file, I don't have a reader for it. I'll figure it out.

You should find all the code in the OpenGL-Code folder, and all textures used
in the texture folder. 

There should be three fragment shaders for all the codes using textures:
1. A normal gradient based shader, or maybe just plain color.(fragmentshader)
2. A time varying shader.(fragmentshaderx)
3. A texture.(fragmentshaderxx)

I know I should've defined a class for the shaders, but as of Monday 9PM, I
still haven't coded the whole class structure once by myself; It will surely be
present in further projects. A lot of time was spent in figuring out Arrays :P

Feel free to use all the textures. There are some circular ones specifically for
the disc, but somehow it was just not working and i reverted back to a simpler
one.
